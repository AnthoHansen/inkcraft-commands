# InkCraft-Commands

## Warning
**This script is intended for development and testing purposes only.** It is not recommended for use in production environments with the **STANDALONE** config, as any player with access to the command can execute it and potentially expose sensitive command information. Always ensure proper permissions and security measures are in place before deploying any scripts on a live server.
